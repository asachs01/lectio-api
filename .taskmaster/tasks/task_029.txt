# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement API Documentation and Developer Experience
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 24, 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI 3.0, implement Swagger UI, and develop resources to enhance the developer experience.
# Details:
1. Install and configure Swagger tools: `npm install swagger-jsdoc@6.2.8 swagger-ui-express@4.6.2 @types/swagger-ui-express@4.1.3`
2. Create OpenAPI 3.0 specification:
   - Define all API endpoints
   - Document request/response schemas
   - Add examples for each endpoint
   - Document authentication requirements
   - Add error responses
3. Implement Swagger UI for interactive documentation
4. Create route for API documentation: GET /api/v1/docs
5. Generate code examples for common programming languages
6. Create Postman collection for API testing:
   - Include all endpoints
   - Add example requests
   - Create environment variables
7. Develop comprehensive developer guide:
   - Getting started guide
   - Authentication guide
   - Common use cases
   - Best practices
8. Add request/response examples to documentation
9. Implement SDK generation for multiple languages using OpenAPI Generator
10. Create interactive API playground

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate OpenAPI specification against schema
2. Test Swagger UI functionality
3. Verify documentation accuracy for all endpoints
4. Test generated code examples
5. Validate Postman collection works correctly
6. User testing of developer documentation
7. Verify SDK generation works for target languages
8. Test interactive API playground

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Swagger Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the project environment by installing and configuring Swagger-related packages (swagger-jsdoc, swagger-ui-express, @types/swagger-ui-express) for API documentation in a Node.js (Express) application.
### Details:
Run npm install commands to add Swagger dependencies. Import and configure these packages in the Express app to prepare for documentation generation and serving.[1][2][3][4]

## 2. Create Comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 Specification [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Develop a detailed OpenAPI 3.0 specification that defines all API endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication requirements, error responses, and includes examples for each endpoint.
### Details:
Use swagger-jsdoc to annotate routes and generate the OpenAPI specification. Ensure all endpoints, parameters, responses, and security schemes are fully documented with examples and error cases.[2][3]

## 3. Implement and Serve Swagger UI for Interactive Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Integrate Swagger UI into the Express application to provide interactive, web-based API documentation accessible to developers.
### Details:
Configure swagger-ui-express to serve the generated OpenAPI documentation at a dedicated route (e.g., /api/v1/docs). Ensure the UI allows endpoint testing and displays all documented features.[1][2][3][4]

## 4. Develop Developer Experience Resources and Guides [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Create comprehensive developer resources, including a getting started guide, authentication instructions, common use cases, best practices, and code examples for multiple programming languages.
### Details:
Draft and publish documentation that helps developers onboard quickly, understand authentication, and use the API effectively. Include code samples and usage scenarios for popular languages.

## 5. Generate and Distribute API Testing and SDK Resources [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4
### Description: Produce a Postman collection covering all endpoints, generate SDKs for multiple languages using OpenAPI Generator, and create an interactive API playground for hands-on testing.
### Details:
Export a Postman collection with example requests and environment variables. Use OpenAPI Generator to create SDKs. Set up an interactive playground for real-time API exploration.
