# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement Monitoring and Logging System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 24, 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting infrastructure to track application performance, errors, and security events.
# Details:
1. Install logging packages: `npm install winston@3.8.2 morgan@1.10.0 @types/morgan@1.9.4`
2. Configure structured logging with Winston:
   - Define log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
   - Configure log format (JSON for production)
   - Set up log rotation
3. Implement HTTP request logging with Morgan
4. Add application performance monitoring:
   - Install and configure Prometheus client: `npm install prom-client@14.2.0`
   - Create custom metrics for key operations
   - Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization
5. Implement error tracking and alerting:
   - Centralized error handling
   - Error notification system
   - Error categorization and prioritization
6. Add database query performance monitoring:
   - Log slow queries
   - Track query execution times
   - Monitor connection pool usage
7. Implement security audit logging:
   - Authentication attempts
   - Authorization failures
   - API key usage
   - Admin operations
8. Create health check endpoints:
   - GET /api/v1/health - Basic health check
   - GET /api/v1/health/detailed - Detailed system status
9. Set up log aggregation and analysis
10. Configure alerting thresholds and notification channels

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify logs are correctly generated and formatted
2. Test error tracking with simulated errors
3. Validate metrics collection and visualization
4. Test health check endpoints
5. Verify alerting works with test alerts
6. Test log rotation and retention
7. Validate security audit logging captures relevant events
8. Test performance monitoring under load
