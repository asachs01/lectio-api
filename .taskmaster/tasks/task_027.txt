# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Search and Query Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 24, 25
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive search and query functionality including full-text search, filtering, and advanced search options across lectionary data.
# Details:
1. Install and configure full-text search capabilities:
   - Use PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search
   - Create text search configurations for religious texts
   - Add text search vectors to relevant tables
2. Implement search endpoints:
   - GET /api/v1/search/readings - Search readings
   - GET /api/v1/search/scripture - Search by scripture reference
   - GET /api/v1/search/keyword - Keyword search
3. Develop advanced filtering options:
   - Filter by tradition
   - Filter by liturgical year/cycle
   - Filter by season
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by scripture book/chapter/verse
4. Implement query builder pattern for complex queries
5. Add fuzzy search capabilities for approximate matches:
   - Use pg_trgm extension in PostgreSQL
   - Configure similarity thresholds
6. Optimize search performance:
   - Create appropriate indexes for search fields
   - Implement query result caching
   - Use pagination for large result sets
7. Create search result highlighting:
   - Highlight matching terms in results
   - Provide context around matches
8. Implement search analytics to track popular searches

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for search query construction
2. Test full-text search with various queries
3. Verify filtering works correctly with combinations of filters
4. Performance testing for search operations
5. Test fuzzy search with misspelled terms
6. Validate search result highlighting
7. Test pagination of search results
8. Verify search works across different traditions
