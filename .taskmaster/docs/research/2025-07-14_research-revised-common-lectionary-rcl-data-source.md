# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Research Revised Common Lectionary (RCL) data sources, formats, and structures. Include information about liturgical cycles, year classifications (A, B, C), seasonal structure, and where to obtain reliable RCL data for API development.

**Response:**

## Revised Common Lectionary (RCL): Data Sources, Formats, and Structures

### Overview of the RCL

The **Revised Common Lectionary (RCL)** is a three-year cycle of weekly scripture readings used by many Christian denominations for worship planning. It is designed to cover a broad spectrum of the Bible, providing a structured approach to reading scripture throughout the liturgical year. The RCL was finalized in 1992 after extensive ecumenical consultation and testing, building on earlier lectionary models and addressing concerns about the selection and arrangement of readings[1].

---

### Liturgical Cycles and Year Classifications

The RCL operates on a **three-year cycle**, with each year designated as **Year A, Year B, or Year C**:

- **Year A**: Focuses primarily on the Gospel of Matthew.
- **Year B**: Focuses on the Gospel of Mark (with some readings from John).
- **Year C**: Focuses on the Gospel of Luke.

The Gospel of John is interspersed throughout all three years, especially during major liturgical seasons such as Lent and Easter[1].

Each year begins with the **First Sunday of Advent**, which typically falls in late November or early December. The cycle then proceeds through the liturgical seasons, repeating every three years.

---

### Seasonal Structure

The RCL is organized around the **liturgical calendar**, which includes the following primary seasons:

- **Advent**: Four Sundays before Christmas, focusing on anticipation and preparation.
- **Christmas**: Celebrates the birth of Christ.
- **Epiphany**: Begins January 6, focusing on the revelation of Christ to the world.
- **Lent**: Begins with Ash Wednesday, a period of penitence leading up to Easter.
- **Holy Week**: Includes Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday.
- **Easter**: Celebrates the resurrection, lasting 50 days until Pentecost.
- **Pentecost/Ordinary Time**: The longest season, focusing on the life and teachings of Jesus and the growth of the Church.

Each Sunday and major feast day is assigned a set of readings: typically an Old Testament lesson, a Psalm, an Epistle, and a Gospel reading[1][3].

---

### Data Formats and Structures

#### Common Data Formats

RCL data is available in several **structured formats** suitable for API development and database ingestion:

- **Excel (XLS/XLSX)**: Tabular format with columns for date, liturgical day, season, year (A/B/C), and scripture references[2].
- **Word (DOC/DOCX)**: Textual format, often with tables or lists[2].
- **PDF**: Printable, formatted for handouts or bulletins[2][4].
- **Plain Text/CSV**: Some sources provide CSV or plain text for easier parsing (though less common in official sources).

#### Example Data Structure

A typical RCL data row might include:

| Date       | Liturgical Day      | Season   | Year | Old Testament | Psalm | Epistle | Gospel  |
|------------|---------------------|----------|------|---------------|-------|---------|---------|
| 2025-12-07 | 2nd Sunday of Advent| Advent   | B    | Isaiah 40:1-11| Psalm 85:1-2,8-13 | 2 Peter 3:8-15a | Mark 1:1-8 |

Additional metadata may include:

- **Reading type** (e.g., gospel, epistle, OT, psalm)
- **Optional readings** (indicated by brackets or alternative references)
- **Liturgical color** (e.g., purple for Advent/Lent, white for Christmas/Easter)
- **Special notes** (e.g., feast days, alternative readings)[3]

---

### Reliable RCL Data Sources

For **API development** and robust data ingestion, the following sources are recommended:

- **Vanderbilt Divinity Library Lectionary Site**: Offers downloadable RCL data for multiple years in Excel, Word, and PDF formats. This is one of the most comprehensive and widely used sources for RCL data[2].
  - Data is organized by year and cycle, with clear scripture references and liturgical day labels.
  - Printable PDFs and handout formats are also available[4].
- **Church of England Lectionary**: Provides tables and rules for readings, including alternative readings and psalm arrangements. Useful for understanding structural conventions and edge cases[3].
- **Denominational Resources**: Many denominations publish their own RCL tables, sometimes with minor adaptations. These can be cross-referenced for validation.

---

### Considerations for API and Database Design

#### Schema Recommendations

Given the RCL's structure, your **PostgreSQL schema** should include:

- **Lectionary cycles**: Table for Year A/B/C, with start and end dates.
- **Liturgical seasons**: Table for Advent, Christmas, etc., with color and date ranges.
- **Liturgical days**: Table for each Sunday/feast, with date, name, season, and cycle.
- **Readings**: Table for each scripture reference, type (gospel, epistle, etc.), and linkage to liturgical day.
- **Metadata**: Fields for optional readings, alternative readings, and notes.

#### Search and Query Implementation

For **Task 8**, ensure your search endpoints can:

- Filter by **scripture reference** (book, chapter, verse)
- Filter by **liturgical season** (e.g., Advent, Lent)
- Filter by **cycle** (A, B, C)
- Filter by **reading type** (gospel, epistle, etc.)
- Support **full-text search** for keywords and themes

Edge cases to handle:

- **Alternative readings** (e.g., two options for a Sunday)
- **Special feast days** that override regular Sundays
- **Variable date ranges** for movable feasts (Easter, Pentecost)

---

### Edge Cases and Pitfalls

- **Date Calculation**: Some liturgical days (e.g., Easter) are movable and require algorithmic calculation for each year.
- **Optional/Alternative Readings**: Some Sundays offer choices; your schema should support multiple readings per type.
- **Denominational Variations**: While the RCL is widely adopted, some traditions make minor adjustments. Consider supporting custom lectionary tables for flexibility.
- **Scripture Reference Parsing**: Ensure robust parsing for references with ranges, alternatives, and partial verses (e.g., John 3:16a).

---

### Example: Ingesting RCL Data

To ingest RCL data from Vanderbilt's Excel files:

1. **Download the relevant year/cycle file** (e.g., Year B 2023-2024 Excel)[2].
2. **Parse each row** to extract date, liturgical day, season, cycle, and scripture references.
3. **Normalize scripture references** for consistent querying (e.g., "Mark 1:1-8").
4. **Store readings** in your database, linking to liturgical day and season tables.
5. **Implement search indices** on scripture reference, season, cycle, and reading type for efficient querying.

### Actionable Steps for Your Project

- **Download RCL data** from Vanderbilt for all cycles and years you wish to support[2].
- **Design your database schema** to reflect the RCL's hierarchical structure (cycle → season → day → readings).
- **Implement robust parsing** for scripture references and alternative readings.
- **Support advanced search and filtering** in your API endpoints as outlined in Task 8.
- **Plan for edge cases** such as movable feasts, alternative readings, and denominational variations.

By leveraging these authoritative data sources and structuring your database accordingly, you will ensure your API provides comprehensive, accurate, and flexible access to the Revised Common Lectionary for a wide range of user queries and use cases.
