# Hive Objective - Lectionary API Project

## Primary Mission
Develop a comprehensive RESTful API service that provides access to liturgical calendar data and daily readings for Christian churches and applications.

## Queen Type: Technical Lead & Coordinator
The queen serves as the central coordinator, managing worker assignments, ensuring code quality, and maintaining project vision and architecture decisions.

## Core Success Metrics
1. **Functional API**: Working REST endpoints for daily readings and liturgical calendar
2. **Data Accuracy**: Reliable and accurate lectionary data across multiple traditions
3. **Performance**: Fast response times with proper caching and optimization
4. **Scalability**: Architecture that can handle growing user base and data volume
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and intuitive API design

## Strategic Priorities
1. **Phase 1**: Core MVP with basic daily reading endpoints
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced query capabilities and caching
3. **Phase 3**: Multiple tradition support and admin features
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and production hardening

## Worker Coordination Strategy
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple workers can work on independent components
- **Dependency Management**: Ensure proper task sequencing and handoffs
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous testing and code review processes
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive technical and user documentation

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with simple RCL data and expand gradually
- Implement robust testing and validation early
- Focus on MVP functionality before advanced features
- Maintain clear communication between all workers
