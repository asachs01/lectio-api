# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Deployment and Infrastructure Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 28, 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment to production environments.
# Details:
1. Create Docker configuration:
   - Write Dockerfile for application
   - Create docker-compose.yml for local development
   - Optimize Docker image size and security
2. Configure Kubernetes deployment:
   - Create deployment manifests
   - Configure services and ingress
   - Set up persistent volumes for data
   - Configure horizontal pod autoscaling
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:
   - Configure workflow files (.github/workflows/)
   - Set up build, test, and deployment stages
   - Configure environment-specific deployments
   - Implement rollback capability
4. Set up cloud infrastructure:
   - Configure production database (managed PostgreSQL)
   - Set up Redis cache (managed Redis)
   - Configure load balancer
   - Set up CDN for static assets
5. Implement database backup and recovery:
   - Scheduled backups
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Backup verification
6. Configure SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt:
   - Automatic certificate renewal
   - HTTPS redirection
   - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
7. Set up environment-specific configurations:
   - Development
   - Testing
   - Staging
   - Production
8. Implement infrastructure monitoring and alerting

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Docker container builds and runs correctly
2. Test Kubernetes deployment in test environment
3. Validate CI/CD pipeline with test deployment
4. Test database backup and recovery procedures
5. Verify SSL/TLS configuration
6. Test environment-specific configurations
7. Validate load balancing and high availability
8. Perform disaster recovery testing
