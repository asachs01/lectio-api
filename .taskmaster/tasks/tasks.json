Ensure proper date calculations for variable liturgical seasons like Lent and Easter which depend on the Easter date calculation for each year.\n\n4. Implement a validation function to verify that all dates through November 2025 have a corresponding season assigned.\n\n5.

This resolves the issue where currentSeason was returning null for dates after February 2025 due to missing seasons in the database. The implementation follows production data seeding best practices and has been deployed to the production environment for testing.\n</info added on 2025-09-02T15:36:34.454Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-02T15:44:49.475Z>\nReverted changes to import-rcl-with-dates.ts due to critical production issues. The implementation of createAllLiturgicalSeasons function caused 500 errors across all calendar endpoints in production. Service is currently degraded with all calendar endpoints failing. Will pursue an alternative approach by developing a standalone database migration/update script that can safely add the missing liturgical seasons without modifying the main seeding process. This approach will allow for more controlled testing before affecting production data flow.\n</info added on 2025-09-02T15:44:49.475Z>",
