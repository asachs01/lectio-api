## Worker Coordination Protocol

### Task Assignment Strategy
1. **Parallel Initialization**: All workers begin with foundation tasks
2. **Dependency-Based Progression**: Workers pick up tasks as dependencies complete
3. **Specialization Focus**: Each worker prioritizes tasks in their domain
4. **Cross-Functional Support**: Workers assist outside their specialty when needed

### Communication Framework
- **Daily Standups**: Brief status updates and blocker identification
- **Architecture Reviews**: Analyst leads design discussions
- **Code Reviews**: All workers participate in quality assurance
- **Testing Coordination**: Tester validates all implementations

### Quality Gates
1. **Code Quality**: All code must pass review and testing
2. **Documentation**: Features must be properly documented
3. **Performance**: APIs must meet response time requirements
4. **Security**: All endpoints must follow security best practices
