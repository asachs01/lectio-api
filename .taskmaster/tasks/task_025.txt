# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Multi-Tradition Lectionary Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the system to support multiple lectionary traditions (RCL, Catholic, Episcopal/Anglican, Lutheran) with tradition-specific calendar calculations and cycles.
# Details:
1. Research and document the calendar calculation rules for each tradition:
   - Revised Common Lectionary (RCL): 3-year cycle (A, B, C)
   - Catholic lectionary: 3-year Sunday cycle, 2-year weekday cycle
   - Episcopal/Anglican: Based on RCL with modifications
   - Lutheran: Based on RCL with modifications
2. Implement calendar calculation service:
   - Calculate liturgical dates (Advent, Christmas, Epiphany, Lent, Easter, Pentecost, etc.)
   - Determine current liturgical year and cycle
   - Handle special days and feast days
3. Create tradition-specific adapters implementing a common interface
4. Implement factory pattern for tradition selection
5. Develop data models for tradition-specific variations
6. Create mapping between traditions for equivalent dates/readings
7. Implement cycle determination logic (A, B, C)
8. Add configuration for tradition-specific settings
9. Create utility functions for date calculations across traditions
10. Implement extensible framework for adding new traditions

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for calendar calculations in each tradition
2. Test cycle determination logic
3. Verify special days are correctly identified
4. Test tradition-specific adaptations
5. Integration tests across multiple traditions
6. Validate liturgical year transitions
7. Test with historical dates to verify calculations
8. Verify extensibility by adding a test tradition
