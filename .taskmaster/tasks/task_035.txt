# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Advanced Security Features and Hardening
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 24, 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the security posture of the application with advanced security features, vulnerability scanning, and security best practices.
# Details:
1. Implement security headers:
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-XSS-Protection
   - Referrer-Policy
2. Add CSRF protection: `npm install csurf@1.11.0 @types/csurf@1.11.1`
3. Implement input validation and sanitization:
   - Validate all API inputs
   - Sanitize user-generated content
   - Prevent SQL injection
4. Configure rate limiting and brute force protection:
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Progressive delays
   - IP-based rate limiting
5. Set up security scanning in CI/CD pipeline:
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Container security scanning
6. Implement secure coding practices:
   - Avoid eval() and other unsafe functions
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling
7. Configure security monitoring and alerting:
   - Monitor for suspicious activities
   - Alert on security events
   - Log security-related actions
8. Implement API abuse prevention:
   - Request throttling
   - Anomaly detection
   - Blocking of malicious clients
9. Conduct security audit and penetration testing
10. Create security incident response plan

# Test Strategy:
1. Run vulnerability scanning tools
2. Test security headers implementation
3. Attempt CSRF attacks to verify protection
4. Test input validation with malicious inputs
5. Verify rate limiting under attack conditions
6. Test brute force protection
7. Validate dependency security
8. Conduct penetration testing on critical endpoints
