# Task ID: 22
# Title: Design and Implement Database Schema
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a PostgreSQL database schema that supports multiple lectionary traditions, liturgical years, seasons, and readings.
# Details:
1. Install PostgreSQL client: `npm install pg@8.10.0 @types/pg@8.6.6`
2. Install TypeORM for ORM capabilities: `npm install typeorm@0.3.15 reflect-metadata@0.1.13`
3. Design database schema with the following entities:
   - Tradition (id, name, description)
   - LiturgicalYear (id, name, start_date, end_date, cycle, tradition_id)
   - Season (id, name, start_date, end_date, color, liturgical_year_id)
   - SpecialDay (id, name, date, description, tradition_id, is_feast_day)
   - Reading (id, date, tradition_id, liturgical_year_id, season_id, special_day_id, scripture_reference, text, translation)
   - Scripture (id, book, chapter, verse_start, verse_end, text, translation)
4. Implement proper indexing on frequently queried fields:
   - date, tradition_id on Reading table
   - scripture_reference on Reading table
   - book, chapter on Scripture table
5. Create TypeORM entity classes for each table
6. Implement database migrations using TypeORM migration system
7. Create seed data for at least one tradition (RCL)
8. Implement database connection pooling for performance
9. Add foreign key constraints and cascading rules
10. Document schema with entity-relationship diagram

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for entity models
2. Test database migrations (up and down)
3. Verify foreign key constraints work correctly
4. Test data insertion and retrieval operations
5. Validate indexing improves query performance
6. Test database connection pooling under load
7. Verify seed data is correctly inserted

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define and Normalize Database Entities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify all required entities (Tradition, LiturgicalYear, Season, SpecialDay, Reading, Scripture) and normalize their attributes to at least third normal form to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity.
### Details:
Analyze the relationships and attributes for each entity, ensuring proper normalization and clear separation of concerns. Document entity fields and relationships, considering extensibility for multi-tradition support.

## 2. Design Foreign Key Relationships and Constraints [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Establish foreign key relationships between entities to enforce referential integrity and define cascading rules for updates and deletions.
### Details:
Map out all foreign key dependencies (e.g., tradition_id, liturgical_year_id) and implement appropriate ON DELETE/UPDATE CASCADE or RESTRICT rules. Add constraints to prevent orphaned records and ensure data consistency.

## 3. Implement Indexing and PostgreSQL Optimization Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Identify frequently queried fields and implement appropriate indexes to optimize query performance, considering PostgreSQL-specific features and multi-tradition support.
### Details:
Add indexes on fields such as date, tradition_id, scripture_reference, book, and chapter. Evaluate the need for composite indexes and partial indexes based on expected query patterns. Consider schema design best practices for PostgreSQL performance.

## 4. Create TypeORM Entity Classes and Migrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3
### Description: Translate the database schema into TypeORM entity classes and implement migration scripts to manage schema changes.
### Details:
Define TypeORM models for each entity, including field types, relationships, and constraints. Write migration scripts to create and update tables, indexes, and constraints in PostgreSQL.

## 5. Seed Initial Data and Implement Connection Pooling [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.4
### Description: Seed the database with initial data for at least one tradition (e.g., RCL) and configure PostgreSQL connection pooling for performance and scalability.
### Details:
Develop scripts to insert representative seed data for all entities. Set up connection pooling using PostgreSQL best practices to handle concurrent API requests efficiently.

## 6. Document Schema and Generate Entity-Relationship Diagram [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.5
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation of the schema, including an entity-relationship diagram and explanations of indexing and optimization strategies.
### Details:
Use ERD tools to visualize entities and relationships. Document indexing choices, normalization decisions, and multi-tradition support mechanisms for future maintainers.
