# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Testing Framework and Quality Assurance
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 21, 23, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and automated testing in CI/CD pipeline.
# Details:
1. Install testing frameworks and tools: `npm install jest@29.5.0 @types/jest@29.5.0 ts-jest@29.1.0 supertest@6.3.3 @types/supertest@2.0.12`
2. Configure Jest for TypeScript testing
3. Create test directory structure:
   - `/tests/unit` - Unit tests
   - `/tests/integration` - Integration tests
   - `/tests/e2e` - End-to-end tests
   - `/tests/performance` - Performance tests
4. Implement unit tests for all business logic:
   - Service layer tests
   - Utility function tests
   - Model tests
5. Create integration tests for API endpoints:
   - Test all endpoints with various parameters
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Test error handling
6. Implement end-to-end testing for critical workflows:
   - User registration and authentication
   - Data retrieval workflows
   - Search functionality
7. Set up load testing using Artillery: `npm install artillery@2.0.0-31 --save-dev`
8. Configure test coverage reporting with Istanbul/nyc: `npm install nyc@15.1.0 --save-dev`
9. Implement security testing:
   - Authentication bypass testing
   - Input validation testing
   - Rate limiting testing
10. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:
    - Run tests on pull requests
    - Generate and publish test coverage reports
    - Enforce minimum test coverage thresholds

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify test framework setup works correctly
2. Run unit tests and validate coverage
3. Execute integration tests against test environment
4. Run end-to-end tests for critical workflows
5. Perform load testing to validate performance requirements
6. Verify security tests identify vulnerabilities
7. Test CI/CD pipeline integration
8. Validate test coverage reporting

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Testing Frameworks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Jest, ts-jest, Supertest, and related TypeScript types. Configure Jest for TypeScript compatibility using ts-jest and create a base jest.config.js file.
### Details:
Run npm install commands for jest, ts-jest, @types/jest, supertest, and @types/supertest. Set up jest.config.js with the appropriate preset and test environment for TypeScript.

## 2. Establish Test Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Create a standardized directory structure for different test types, including unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance tests.
### Details:
Set up /tests/unit, /tests/integration, /tests/e2e, and /tests/performance directories to organize test files by category.

## 3. Implement Unit Tests for Business Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.2
### Description: Write comprehensive unit tests for service layers, utility functions, and data models using Jest.
### Details:
Develop test cases that cover all critical business logic, ensuring each function and method is tested in isolation.

## 4. Develop Integration and API Endpoint Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.3
### Description: Create integration tests using Supertest to validate API endpoints, including parameter handling, authentication, and error scenarios.
### Details:
Write tests that simulate HTTP requests to API endpoints, checking for correct responses, status codes, and error handling.

## 5. Set Up End-to-End and Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.4
### Description: Implement end-to-end tests for critical workflows and configure performance/load testing using Artillery.
### Details:
Write E2E tests for user registration, authentication, and data retrieval. Set up Artillery scripts for load testing key endpoints.

## 6. Integrate Automated Testing into CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.5
### Description: Configure GitHub Actions to run all tests on pull requests, generate coverage reports, and enforce minimum coverage thresholds.
### Details:
Set up CI workflows to automate test execution, publish coverage reports, and block merges if coverage falls below defined thresholds.
