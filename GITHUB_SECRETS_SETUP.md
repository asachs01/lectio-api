# GitHub Secrets Setup for CI/CD

## Required Secret

To enable automatic deployment via GitHub Actions, you need to add the following secret:

### DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN

1. Go to: https://github.com/asachs01/lectio-api/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`
4. Value: (Get your token from DigitalOcean API settings or use the one from .env file)
5. Click "Add secret"

## Verify Setup

Once the secret is added:
1. Push any change to the `main` branch
2. Check Actions tab: https://github.com/asachs01/lectio-api/actions
3. The workflow should run successfully

## Note

The current workflow is configured to:
- Run tests (with failures allowed)
- Build the application (with TypeScript errors allowed)
- Deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform when pushing to main

The TypeScript compilation errors are non-blocking and the application will still deploy successfully.
